## Appendix

### Calculation Formulas

#### Gross Pay Calculation
```
Gross Pay = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay
Regular Pay = Regular Hours × Hourly Rate
Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours × Hourly Rate × 1.25
```

#### Deductions Calculation
```
SSS - Based on SSS contribution table
PhilHealth = Gross Pay × 0.03 / 2 (employee share)
Pag-IBIG = Gross Pay × 0.02
Withholding Tax - Based on progressive tax table
```

#### Allowances Calculation
```
Pro-rated Allowance = (Monthly Allowance / 21) × Working Days
```

### SSS Contribution Table

The system uses a comprehensive SSS contribution table. Here's a sample of some brackets:

| Monthly Salary Range | SSS Contribution |
|----------------------|------------------|
| 0 - 4,249.99         | 180.00           |
| 4,250 - 4,749.99     | 202.50           |
| 4,750 - 5,249.99     | 225.00           |
| 5,250 - 5,749.99     | 247.50           |
| ...                  | ...              |
| 20,250 - 20,749.99   | 900.00           |
| 20,750 and above     | 945.00           |
